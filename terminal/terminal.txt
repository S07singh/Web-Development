ls = list files(show my files) in the directory(folders)

pwd = print working directory  
(where am i?)

clear = clear screen

cd = change directory 

cd (folder name)
cd (folder name)/(folder name)

if you want to come back then use the (cd ..)
cd ../..

cd Desktop/Delta(relative path) -> current location

cd/users/shradhakhapra/Desktop(absolute path)

/= root directory

~ = home directory

mkdir = make directory (its create folder not file) 

mkdir hello

mkdir /users/shradhakhapra/Desktop/Delta/hello
it will create hello folder in Delta 
we can use relative path and absolute path both for creation of new directory
