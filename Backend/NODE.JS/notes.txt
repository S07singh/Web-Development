// node_modules The node modules folder containing the every installed dependency for your project.

// package-lock.json It records the exact version of every installed dependency, including its sub-dependencies and their version.

//package.json The package.json file contains descriptive and functional metadata about a project, such as a name, version, and dependencies.
// if node_modules delete, we can download with the command (npm install) in terminal

// for making your own package.json use the command (npm init) in terminal

we can download package locally and globally also  then we have to link it
it goods practice to download the package locally

npm install -g <- package name ->
npm link <- package name ->


---> import {sum} form "./math.js"
for this first export it.
then in package.json mention type module

difference between require and import 
we can't selectively load only the pieces we need with require with import,
we can selectively lead only the pieces we need , which can save memory.

Loading is synchronous for 'require' but can be asynchronous for 'import'.
